## About the project

EdMundo platform is a graduation project built by a group of 3 students completing a 1-year full-time further education course in full-stack web development at DCI Digital Career Institute Berlin.

Our goal was to design the platform to be as **user-friendly, straightforward, and intuitive** as possible for individuals with limited computer proficiency. Additionally, we aimed at incorporating all necessary **features** that enable the instructor to conduct online classes in a manner that mimics an in-person classroom setting.
